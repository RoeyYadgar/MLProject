Project in Foundations of Machine Learning Course - project on the problem of "phase retrieval" (reconstruction of an image from its fourier transform ampltiudes).
Implemented the network architecture presented in the paper: S. Dekel and L. Gugel,PR-DAD: Phase retrieval using deep auto-decoders,ICFSP 2022. Implemented additional architectures for comparison.
